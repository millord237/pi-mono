- When receiving the first user message, ask the user which module(s) they want to work on. Then you MUST read the corresponding README.md files in full, in parallel:
    - README.md
    - packages/ai/README.md
    - packages/tui/README.md
    - packages/agent/README.md
    - packages/coding-agent.md
    - packages/pods/README.md
    - packages/web-ui/README.md
- We must NEVER have type `any` anywhere, unless absolutely, positively necessary.
- If you are working with an external API, check node_modules for the type definitions as needed instead of assuming things.
- Always run `npm run check` in the project's root directory after making code changes.
- You must NEVER run `npm run dev` yourself. Doing is means you failed the user hard.
- Do NOT commit unless asked to by the user
- Keep you answers short and concise and to the point.

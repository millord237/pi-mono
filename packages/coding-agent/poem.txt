Through morning mist the sunlight breaks,
A golden path on silver lakes,
The world awakens, soft and new,
With diamond drops of morning dew,
And birds sing songs that daylight makes.

The forest stands in ancient green,
Where shadows dance and light is seen,
Through branches high the breezes play,
And lead the wandering heart away,
To places only dreams have been.

The river flows with endless grace,
Its waters mirror time and space,
It carries stories, old and worn,
Of every soul that's ever born,
And every smile on every face.

When evening falls with purple hue,
The stars emerge in cosmic view,
They whisper secrets from afar,
Each distant, shimmering, silent star,
A reminder what we thought we knew.

So let us walk this earthly ground,
Where beauty, pain, and love are found,
Embrace the journey, come what may,
For every night will yield to day,
And silence always turns to sound.
